RELOAD: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have on free hand to reload a firearm.  MISFIRE: Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal or lower than the weapon's Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack missed, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tikner's Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If you check fails, the weapons is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon's misfire score by 1. EXPLOSIVE: Upon a hit, everyting within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon missed, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so. AMMUNITION: All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker's Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches.",
